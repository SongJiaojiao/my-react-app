However, what does it really mean in teachers' everyday life?\n\nWe dug into Study Island as a starting point of this problem. Supporting over 24,000 schools, Study Island provides a wealth of data to improve teachers' teaching. However, a large number of teachers never access the data, or use it to inform teaching.\n\nWe realized it's not the quantity of the data that counts, but how it is being used. Thus, our goal is to encourage teachers to use the data more frequently in a way that truly helps with their teaching."} />

But this is not how teachers think. They think in questions about their students.' }, { Title: 'Hard to take actions', Description: 'A few experienced teachers have developed their own ways of interpreting data. For these power users, they are seeking explicit next-steps, which is not supported in the current platform.' }]}></BlockwithBullets>

We started literature review and competitive analysis to understand the current landscape.\n\nWe translated the key concepts into a framework that captiond our direction. Our high-level after this stage was to design a platform that informs teaching decisions on an individual level."} />
            <TextImageBlock imgLink={'/lighthouse/affinity.png'} Title={"Why Don't Teachers Use Data?"} borderRadius={'16px'} Description={"In order to dive into Study Island's users experience using data, we talked to 13 teachers in 4 states. Although teachers have different purposes (Remediation, Test Prep, Practice) for using Study Island, their general workflow is quite similar: access, interpret and take actions.\n\nWe segmented our users into three groups based on their frequency of data usage and engagement with the platform. It is not surprising that, as Study Island is becoming a more integral piece into their daily teaching, their needs also evolve."} />

Through user research, we developed three design alternatives: direct report access, data summaries, and smart search.Our initial testing with teachers indicated a preference for immediate data insights, leading us to craft the homepage into a dashboard for a snapshot of the data."} />

To strike the right balance between getting things done quickly and giving teachers control, we provided users with the options to edit questions and dismiss the recommendations. This flexibility could be pivotal in fostering teachers' trust and encouraging adoption of the recommendations feature."} />
